## New Things (Front-End)

### Learned about [:host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host()), which lets you apply CSS to an entire component.

```css
:host {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

Rather than having a wrapper element within the component, *:host* will target the entire component and apply any defind CSS to it.  The default display of a component is **inline**, which is why, for this example, display is set to block.  Without being set to block, the margin will not be applied.

### Using the formsModule to get input data without using two-way data binding

Below is an example of an input element set-up with ngModel
```html
<input
  type="text"
  name="title"
  ngModel
  #title="ngModel">
```

an *ngModel* and *reference* property (#title) are needed on the input.  When a form is submitted, the input field/s is referenced based on its *name* attribute.

The **form** element looks something like this:
```html
<form (submit)="onAddPost(postForm)" #postForm="ngForm">
  <!-- inputs and buttons -->
</form>
```

The *postForm* is referenced and passed into the method that runs when the form is submitted:
```javascript
onAddPost(form: NgForm) {
  if (form.invalid) {
    return;
  }
  const post: Post = { title: form.value.title, content: form.value.content };
  this.postCreated.emit(post);
}
```
By referencing the form, I can access the form inputs by their name.  I can also prevent an invalid form submission by checking if the form is valid or not.

### Referencing inputs to display errors

Using Angular Material, the process for showing error messages based on valid form fields is straight forward.  The first thing is to ensure that the input fields have references:
```html
<textarea
  required
  matInput
  type="text"
  name="content"
  ngModel
  #content="ngModel"></textarea>
```

In the example above, **#content** is the input reference.  This is used with the Angular Material error element:

```html
<mat-error *ngIf="content.invalid">Please enter a post title</mat-error>
```

In the example above, the *content* is referenced and, because it's of type *ngModel*, it has an *invalid* property which can be accessed.  Depending on if the content is valid or not, an error message is displayed.

---

### Better understanding of Rxjs Subjects

Using rxjs *Subjects* changes can be detected on data and, in the example of the posts in this example, can be re-rendered to show updated data.

Subjects are *Observables* that emit a *next()* value as shown below with *this.postsUpdated.next()*

```javascript
addPost(title: string, content: string) {
    const post: Post = {title, content};
    this.posts.push(post);
    // Listen for updated posts
    this.postsUpdated.next([...this.posts]);
  }
```

Although a *Subject* can be directly subscribed to, a best practice is to set it as private and return it as an Observable using the *asObservable()* method:

```javascript
// No longer can be directly described to due to being private
private postsUpdated = new Subject<Post[]>();

/**
 * Listen for new posts added to array
 * @returns {Observable<Post[]>}
 */
getPostupdateListener() {
  return this.postsUpdated.asObservable();
}
```

Then, in the component that is listening for changes, the method can be subscribed to:

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  this.posts = this.postsService.getPosts();
  // Listening here
  this.postsSub = this.postsService.getPostupdateListener()
    .subscribe((posts: Post[]) => {
      this.posts = posts;
    });
}
```

In order to avoid a memory leak, any subscriptions should unsubscribe when the component is destroyed:

```typescript
ngOnDestroy() {
  this.postsSub.unsubscribe();
}
```

### Using *routerLinkActive* with Angular Material

The Angular *routerLinkActive* property will apply a class on a page link if it is the current page.  Angular Material has some helper methods that will apply styling so that you don't have to define an "active" class yourself

```html
<li><a mat-button routerLink="/create" routerLinkActive="mat-accent">New Post</a></li>
```

In the example above, *routerLinkActive* is assigned the Angular Material class *mat-accent* and, when the page is navigated to, applies the Material Design styling defined by the application.

## "Elvis" Operator (?)

For this application, when editing a post, the correct data is fetched to display the post that is being edited.  However, when refreshing the page while on the selected post, the console displays an error because, when initially loading the page, there is no data to display since it is fetched asynchronously.

To avoid the errors generated on the initial page load, an *Elvis (?)* operator is used on the HTML inputs:

```html
<input
  [ngModel]="post?.title">
```

With the *Elvis* operator in place, the input is filled when the data is retrieved from the back-end and the error is no longer generated.

## Proxy a file input click to a button

There is a default input type called "file" that will allow the user to choose a local file to upload when it is clicked.  However, the styling does not match with Angular Material, which is being used in this project.

The solution is to proxy a click.  Basically, an Angular Material button is displayed above an *input* element:

```html
<div>
  <button mat-stroked-button type="button" (click)="filePicker.click()">Pick Image</button>
  <input type="file" #filePicker>
</div>
```

The <input> element is hidden in the CSS using an attribute selector:
```css
input[type="file"] {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

The <input> element has a reference associated with it called **#filePicker**.  The Angular Material button then has a *click* attribute on it, that references the **#filePicker** and adds a *click()* method.  This is a proxied click that will open the file selector.

### setValue() and patchValue() With Reactive Forms

Using Reactive Forms in Angular allows for a form and all its properties (values, validators, etc) to be controlled via the TypeScript code.

To set values programatically, the *setValue()* and *patchValue()* methods need to be used:

```typescript
this.form.setValue({
    'title': this.post.title,
    'content': this.post.content
});
``` 

In the above code snippet, *setValue()* needs to set all the form controls to function properly, but if only one form control needs to be set, *patchValue()* should be used:

```typescript
this.form.patchValue({image: file});
```

When patching a value this way, the form control affected should be updated and validated using the *updateValueAndValidity()* method:
```typescript
this.form.get('image').updateValueAndValidity();
```

---

## Implementing a File Reader

1.  Start with the *input* element that detects a change (when a file is uploaded):
```html
<input type="file" #filePicker (change)="onImagePicked($event)">
```

2.  In the *onImagePicked()* method, which takes in an **event** as a parameter
```javascript
const file = (event.target as HTMLInputElement).files[0];
```
  Here, a *file* constant is defined that is casted as an HTMLInputElement.  The casting is necessary for typescript to know that there is a *files* property associated with *event.target*, which returns an array (that's why the first item is chosen ([0])).
  
 3.  Create a new instance of the [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) object to read the uploaded file
 ```javascript
const reader = new FileReader();
```

4.  Use the new FileReader instance to set the result of the uploaded file
```javascript
reader.onload = () => {
  this.imagePreview = reader.result;
};
```
  This is an asynchronous action that sets *this.imagePreview* to the result when the file is finished being uploaded
  
 5.  Using the [readAsDataURL()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL) method, the File will be converted into a URL that the *src* property on an *img* element can use to display the file uploaded

 ```javascript
reader.readAsDataURL(file);
```


## New Things (Back-End)

### Using next()

In Node.js/Express remember to use the next() function to continue along the middleware chain if you are not sending data back.  For example:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('First middleware');
  next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Hello from express');
});
```

In the first *app.use()* function, if **next()** is not used, the program will remain at that middleware and eventually timeout, not loading any of the data from other middleware.

The 2nd *app.use()* method doesn't need a **next()** method because a response is being sent (**res.send()**)
