## New Things

### Learned about [:host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host()), which lets you apply CSS to an entire component.

```css
:host {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

Rather than having a wrapper element within the component, *:host* will target the entire component and apply any defind CSS to it.  The default display of a component is **inline**, which is why, for this example, display is set to block.  Without being set to block, the margin will not be applied.

### Using the formsModule to get input data without using two-way data binding

Below is an example of an input element set-up with ngModel
```html
<input
  type="text"
  name="title"
  ngModel
  #title="ngModel">
```

an *ngModel* and *reference* property (#title) are needed on the input.  When a form is submitted, the input field/s is referenced based on its *name* attribute.

The **form** element looks something like this:
```html
<form (submit)="onAddPost(postForm)" #postForm="ngForm">
  <!-- inputs and buttons -->
</form>
```

The *postForm* is referenced and passed into the method that runs when the form is submitted:
```javascript
onAddPost(form: NgForm) {
  if (form.invalid) {
    return;
  }
  const post: Post = { title: form.value.title, content: form.value.content };
  this.postCreated.emit(post);
}
```
By referencing the form, I can access the form inputs by their name.  I can also prevent an invalid form submission by checking if the form is valid or not.

## Referencing inputs to display errors

Using Angular Material, the process for showing error messages based on valid form fields is straight forward.  The first thing is to ensure that the input fields have references:
```html
<textarea
  required
  matInput
  type="text"
  name="content"
  ngModel
  #content="ngModel"></textarea>
```

In the example above, **#content** is the input reference.  This is used with the Angular Material error element:

```html
<mat-error *ngIf="content.invalid">Please enter a post title</mat-error>
```

In the example above, the *content* is referenced and, because it's of type *ngModel*, it has an *invalid* property which can be accessed.  Depending on if the content is valid or not, an error message is displayed.
